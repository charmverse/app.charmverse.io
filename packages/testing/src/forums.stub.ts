  'Post content that will be shown in appHi r/privacy community, u/carrotcypher here to introduce this AMA. What is this all about?Cryptography (the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets) began thousands of years ago. Through its evolution to the eventual creation of a public encryption standard DES and the invention of public-key cryptography, encryption has suffered one drawback that has been the subject of much research in recent years: in order to read or process data, you have to first decrypt it (which isn’t always safe or possible).In recent years as the internet has pushed towards cloud computing and SaaS (software-as-a-service), the question of how data and programs can be processed and run in untrusted environments has become increasingly important.This is where homomorphic encryption comes in. Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits users to perform computations on their encrypted data without first decrypting it. That means that untrusted environments can store encrypted data, you can run processes against that data and get your result, all without the data ever needing to leave the safety of its encrypted state.This might sound like literal magic to many in our community, but you might recall that so did cryptography itself before you started to learn about and use it. Since it’s becoming more of a force in the privacy / cryptography discussions these days, it’s important as a community that we understand the basics of it and not get left behind in this very quickly approaching future where it will most likely become a major part of cloud computing, SaaS, and machine learning at every major company in the world. To help us all understand it better, we’ve arranged major researchers, developers, and scientists from around the world who work in and lead the homomorphic encryption field to answer your questions, introduce concepts, explain their take and direction, and help explain the vision of the future where homomorphic encryption is as ubiquitous as HTTPS.Since the participants of this AMA are from all over the world, we’ll be starting 00:00 UTC on November 8th through 00:00 UTC November 9th. If things seem a little slow when you’re viewing this post, keep in mind the timezones! You might still get your question answered if some participants want to remain longer, but as they’re all busy doing the work and leading this industry for us all, we want to respect their time.';
