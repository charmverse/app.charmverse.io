        <Text>We're officially turning on payments for CharmVerse Spaces and you're among the first to take part.</Text>
        <Text>
          To keep your Space active and unlock premium features, you'll now need to select a plan and contribute in $DEV
          tokens. This is a big step toward sustainable, community-owned infrastructure and we're excited to build it
          with you.
