        contentText: "by Alexandra Dozet, Community Manager of CharmVerseI love hearing people's stories of how they got into web3. People from all walks of life have landed here, and that's one of the reasons this space is so special. You can find your path, no matter where you're coming from, as long as you're ready to dig in and learn.Where it all started...Beer. That's where I started. Bartender in a small seacoast town, to Sales Manager of a well known northeast (U.S.) brewery, and now web3. How did I get here? Good question.I was approached by a long time friend who had launched his third start-up during the pandemic. We had sporadically chatted about the project he was working on, though most of it didn't make sense to me. NFT...what the hell is that? Mining for Bitcoin...what does that even mean? DAO...huh?! It was like he was speaking a different language!So when he approached me about becoming the Community Manager for CharmVerse, I was surprised. To say the least. Me: \"Why me? You know I know nothing about what you're doing, right?\"Him: \"Yep. I can teach you that, and you can learn. But what we need is someone who can build genuine relationships, and I believe that is your superpower.\" Wow. I was flattered. That he believed me to have a superpower of building rapport.That this successful and well respected figure in this space was coming to me with an opportunity. I decided to take the plunge and start my new adventure. Web3, here I come!I'm coming up on completing month three in web3 and it has certainly been a journey. And away we go...The first couple weeks were spent researching, exploring the new platforms I would be using, and chatting daily with CharmVerse co-founder, Alex Poon, to talk through concepts, provide reading material, podcasts to check out, etc. I was overwhelmed, but excited for a new challenge. I had been in the beer industry for so long it was fun to be exploring something completely new to me. Don't get me wrong, as exciting as this all was, it was quite daunting as well. Sure, I've had days when I close my computer and think \"I'm getting the hang of this, and really love this new job\" and there are days I think \"What have I done?!?\" I walked away from a job I knew and was great at, but I was feeling stagnant and was ready for a change. And boy, did I get one.My first Web3 ConferenceWeek 3 in web3: I was headed to NFT NYC. I had signed up for a number of events but I didn't really know what to expect. Was it all going to be crypto bros that would judge me for being new to this space, or tech geeks that I can't talk to because I know nothing about ... anything, or so it felt. This was not the case at all. It was a great experience! Exhausting but exhilarating at the same time. Everyone I talked to was kind and welcoming. They were happy to make introductions and exchange contact info. Our other co-founder, Matt Casey, came to NY for the conference and we spent multiple days hitting events together. This gave me the opportunity to pick his brain anytime a question came to mind, but also getting to know CharmVerse and the company culture a bit better. One of my favorite moments from NFT NYC was an impromptu lunch that a new acquaintance had arranged. She had reached out to a dozen people, inviting all of us to a lunch meet-up in Madison Square Park. It rained so a small group of us ended up in a little mediterranean lunch spot. It was great. An intimate group that I could chat with and practice my \"what is CharmVerse\" spiel. I left feeling like I made some new friends in this industry and I was looking forward to connecting with them after the conference. By the end of the conference, I had helped host a CharmVerse Poker Night, I had attended a bunch of events, met some really great people, and left feeling more knowledgable and confident to move forward with this new job in web3. Month 3 in Web3Two months have passed since NFT NYC and I'm coming up on completing my third month in web3. What a journey it has been. I have been hosting a Women in Web3 interview series through Twitter Spaces, handling the CharmVerse social media, helping CharmVerse users navigate the platform while learning it myself, and continuing to dig and a learn. The more I learn, the more excited I become about this space and my future in web3. It doesn't hurt to have a supportive team by my side, and the people I have been fortunate enough to connect with through work have been a wealth of knowledge and encouragement. Thanks to all of you that have helped make this journey a little less scary. ",

        contentText: "This piece is brought to you by your frens over @CharmVerse. CharmVerse is a web3 operations platform for community contributors to coordinate day-to-day work, sign in with crypto wallets, and unlock workspaces with DAO tokens/NFTs. It brings onboarding, bounty management, proposals, project trackers, and data repositories into one place.Why should you create or join your university‚Äôs blockchain society? üë©‚ÄçüéìWeb3 is taking over the world, each week we see famous brands around the world joining the movement. This industry is growing at an impressive pace, crypto users grew from 10M to 100M in only 3 years, as portrayed in the chart below:One of the pillars of crypto and web3 is community. This idea of being a part of something, a node in a network, the holder of a limited NFT, a contributor in a DAO, or simply a student in a blockchain club (throughout this piece, we make no difference between a club and a society).‚ÄúAlone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much‚Äù ‚Äì Helen KellerAs this curve grows, I believe that web3 natives must share with friends and family the powers of tokenization and decentralization, to empower individuals and introduce them to our geeky world. One way to go about that is by creating a blockchain club. Moreover, is there a better place to learn about web3 than in school? If we wait for the education system to include blockchain courses about its foundations and applications, I am worried our grandkids may still struggle to create their wallets.Last but not least, joining a blockchain club as a student allows you to directly expand your network down the rabbit hole. You can also connect with some of the speakers that the organizations bring on! And anyone involved in the space will confirm that you learn from the people around you in crypto. \"We are at the cutting edge of this industry by virtue of the fact it's new & not saturated. This is literally a once in a career/generation opportunity to be at the top of an industry, rather than starting from the lowest rungs. As such, I'd recommend anyone even vaguely interested to get into Web 3 asap, given it's probably one of the highest leverage career options now if you're looking to go far, earn a lot & learn quickly, etc.\" - AnonDo you need a blockchain club in your uni or can you start on your own? üßêThe answer is simple, no, you do not need to join a blockchain club to get in the space, but it surely will help you out. We remain firm believers that the best way to learn is by experience. So create your wallet, make transactions, join liquidity pools, get an NFT, join a DAO, create a workspace on CharmVerse, etc (this does not constitute financial advice in any way).For the rest of this piece, we will focus on the creation of a blockchain club more than joining existing blockchain clubs.What to do with a Blockchain Club? Structure, Challenges, web3 Education, & Post-grad Environment üìùAfter interviewing some of our frens in US and UK universities, we found that:Structure & ChallengesA lot of web3 and blockchain clubs encountered issues around their legal and expenses structures. Moreover, most universities and colleges are reluctant to engage in this paradigm shift, as they only understand the downside, and care very little about the upside. BAF, the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation, encountered this problem a few years back and established their own non-profit and reached out directly to sponsors outside of the university (UC Santa Barbara). We interviewed Cameron Dennis, BAF's founder, and from his point of view: \"the legal aspect is arguably one of the bigger problems when one starts a blockchain uni club. Today, BAF supports other blockchain uni clubs to get set up, but it can only do so much. For this, to work the leadership of the club needs to be persistent and committed!\"Next on our list, we interviewed Clemens Scherf, from the London Business School. Clemens is the current co-president of the LBS blockchain society. I was curious to hear about why they had co-presidents and not just one president. It turns out they structured their organization and leadership by departments: \"going forward, the leadership team will consist of 2 co-presidents, 1 treasurer, and 1 chief of staff, who coordinates meetings and oversees marketing activities. The pillars have been reduced from 6 to 5, now consisting of ‚ÄòBlockchain 101‚Äô, ‚ÄòWeb3 Labs‚Äô, ‚ÄòResearch & Trading‚Äô, ‚ÄòPartnerships & Careers‚Äô and ‚ÄòDAO & Governance‚Äô.\"When building a blockchain club in a business school, where most people are into investing and not as much into the tech aspect of the blockchain, it creates a certain imbalance. As Benjamin Funk, ex-president of the Babson Blockchain Club: \"having people that are curious about blockchain tech in the group gives opportunities for the club to specialize and create tangible value.\" What we suggest to business schools, and non-technical schools interested in creating their blockchain club is to create a rigorous application process and ensure that you gather a balanced and diverse group of people. This way, you will be able to create value (educational content, professional opportunities, projects) and scale it during your time in university and who knows maybe you will keep on doing so after you graduate!Web3 Education & Post-grad EnvironmentA lot of blockchain clubs contribute as well to the web3 education of their members and ensure they get proper intros to the space. Some even go the step further and place students in protocols, companies, startups, etc. Giving the full experience to their students!We have also seen students who graduated stay involved in the society, and get involved in programs in the likes of the @a16z Token Delegate Program at @MakerDAO, more here!Best practices üìàCreating a DAO for the club helps a lot when it comes to voting within the organization. We have seen clubs voting on leadership, major changes, allocation of budget, etc.Do more than just host events, establish partnerships in the industry, and leverage job boards organized by DAOs. Through DAO bounties you can earn tokens for a couple of hours of work, and then be eligible to join the DAO in question (e.g. Seed Club, check out their job board here!). Getting on Crypto Twitter (CT), to read about the latest updates, ambitions, and opinions from key actors in the space (we put together a list of influential DAO voices on CT, that you can find here). Besides, we strongly suggest creating a wallet and interacting with different protocols, because again, you learn by experience in web3!Provide an intro to web3 course to people that join your society! Some great websites to check out are finematics.com & 0xilluminati.com.Commitment, engagement, and persistence. Make sure to only get motivated and serious people to join the society! Some of the most functional blockchain clubs had bi-weekly meetings mandatory for all the leadership. Giving autonomy to students to shape their roles in such a way that it benefits their careers as well as the overall mission of the club. Remember, web3 in uni should ideally propel you down the rabbit hole post-grad!Tools to use üõ†Today most of the blockchain uni clubs use Discord, Telegram, Notion, and Youtube. We recommend using: Gather.town, a conference tool with little avatars to jump from meeting to meeting, or Huddle01.com, a web3-friendly Zoom.us.CharmVerse.io for ops management.Snapshot.org & AstroDAO.com for voting. If you don't feel like using yet another tool, CharmVerse has built-in Proposal and Voting functions.Twitter to build an online presence and bunches.chat to chat with friends.Thirdweb.com as a no-code tool to launch tokens (coins, NFTs, and more).Mirror.xyz to write articles and paragraph.xyz to write newsletters. Metaschool.so and 101.xyz for educating newbies in the blockchain club!This is the end of our web3 in uni piece, we hope you enjoyed it. We decided to reward our readers for their continued support: fill out this form and you'll receive a CharmVerse NFT, more soon... This piece was authored by Kamil Mouthon.
